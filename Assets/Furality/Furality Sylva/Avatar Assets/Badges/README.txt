HOW TO USE THE BADGE ASSETS
To use the badges, you can attach any of the prefabs found in a tier's folder to a bone of your avatar.

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE BADGES
Each tier's folder contains a textures folder, which contains a PSD file and two badge textures.
You can edit the PSD file to change your name and titles, then you will need to export a texture image using the emission layer (the parts that glow), and a texture image using the color layer.
Once you have the textures with your name, you just need to replace the original textures of the badge's material. Remember to not drag and drop the textures to the badges themselves, but to assign them to the badge's material instead.
If you prefer to use a different image editing software, you can use the empty color and emission textures located in the same folder.
